  <h1>Education</h1>
  <p class="muted">
    TRUEX is neutral. This page helps you interpret betting records correctly —
    and avoid being misled by small samples, selective reporting, or marketing.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <strong>Core idea:</strong> A betting record means nothing unless it is complete, time-locked, and cannot be edited.
    TRUEX exists to make “proof” normal.
  </div>

  <h2>ROI vs Win Rate</h2>

  <p>
    Win rate alone doesn’t tell you if someone is profitable. Odds matter.
    A bettor can win 60% of heavy favorites and still lose money, or win 48% of plus money and be profitable.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If you don’t know the odds distribution, win rate is incomplete information.
  </div>

  <h2>Why sample size matters</h2>

  <p>
    Short streaks happen. A 20–50 bet run can look amazing by pure variance.
    Real edges show up over time, across different market conditions.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Small samples:</strong> easy to fake, easy to misunderstand</li>
    <li><strong>Large samples:</strong> harder to fake, more meaningful</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Drawdowns and variance</h2>

  <p>
    Even profitable bettors experience drawdowns. A record without drawdowns is often incomplete or filtered.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Max Drawdown</strong> helps you understand risk. Two bettors can have the same ROI and wildly different drawdowns.
  </div>

  <h2>Beating the close (CLV)</h2>

  <p>
    Closing Line Value (CLV) is a signal — not a guarantee — that a bettor is consistently getting good numbers.
    Over time, bettors who beat the close tend to perform better than bettors who don’t.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>CLV positive:</strong> often indicates good timing/price</li>
    <li><strong>CLV negative:</strong> may indicate chasing / poor entry</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="box">
    <strong>Important:</strong> CLV is most meaningful in liquid markets with reliable closing lines.
    It can be noisy in small or illiquid markets.
  </div>

  <h2>Timing and odds movement</h2>

  <p>
    Many “good records” are driven by timing — not just picks.
    If someone posts picks after the move, you’re not getting the same bet.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    TRUEX focuses on lock-time enforcement and immutable logging to prevent “after the fact” reporting.
  </div>

  <h2>Common ways records get misrepresented</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Deleting losses</li>
    <li>Only posting winners</li>
    <li>Backfilling old bets</li>
    <li>Changing odds after the fact</li>
    <li>Claiming “I got -110” when market was -130</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How TRUEX helps</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Append-only:</strong> bets can be added, not edited</li>
    <li><strong>Lock-time enforced:</strong> no post-start submissions</li>
    <li><strong>Deterministic publishing:</strong> outputs are reproducible</li>
    <li><strong>Public verification:</strong> raw artifacts + seal metadata</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to improve as a bettor (process-focused)</h2>

  <p>
    TRUEX does not tell you what to bet.
    It helps you improve how you bet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Long-term performance usually improves through process discipline — not hot streaks.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Track everything</h3>
  <p>
    If you delete losses or only record winners, you cannot diagnose mistakes.
    Complete records reveal market bias, overexposure, and emotional patterns.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Focus on price, not just picks</h3>
  <p>
    A bettor hitting 52% at -110 may lose money.
    A bettor hitting 48% at +120 may win.
    Without understanding price distribution, win rate is incomplete.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Use CLV as a feedback loop</h3>
  <p>
    Consistently beating the close often indicates good timing or market understanding.
    CLV is not a guarantee of profit, but persistent negative CLV can signal poor entries.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Control risk and drawdowns</h3>
  <p>
    Two bettors with the same ROI can have very different volatility.
    Large drawdowns destroy bankrolls, trigger emotional decisions, and lead to over-sizing.
    Sustainable performance requires stability.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Respect sample size</h3>
  <p>
    Small runs prove very little.
    Long-term records across multiple seasons and conditions are more meaningful.
    Variance is powerful in betting — process discipline reduces its damage.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Improve timing discipline</h3>
  <p>
    Many “good bets” look profitable only because of timing.
    If you cannot get the posted number, you do not have the same bet.
    TRUEX lock-time enforcement exists to preserve timing integrity.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Final thought:</strong> Improvement is rarely about finding a secret angle.<br />
    It’s usually about consistency, price awareness, risk control, and emotional discipline.
